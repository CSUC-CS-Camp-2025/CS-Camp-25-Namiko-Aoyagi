    <h2>My Favorite Color is Blue!(ノω<。)ノ))☆.。</h2>
    <p>My day yesterday was filled with lots of work and way to much walking, and not nearly enough eating.<br> My extended family came over to visit, I had a call with my uncle, and I was given 300 dollars for my graduation.<br> Somehow, through all that, I ate absoloutely nothing. Then, I speed packed all my stuff and clothing for my summer camp and shoved it into my bags,<br> forgot my paperwork at home, had to go home to grab it again, and finally made it to camp just on time.<br> I was starving at that point, but I wasn't able to leave to eat or anything, but the RAs came to my aide and we got snacks!<br> Then I ate five slices of pizza, helped baked a cake, and went to bed happy.</p>
